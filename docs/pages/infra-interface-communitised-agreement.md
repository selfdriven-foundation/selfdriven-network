## Example based on SDNIIUN01.

*Establishing shared-understanding with community members with tokens.*

**Agreement Date:** \[Insert Date\]

**ID:** SDNIIUN01

---

### **1\. Parties**

This agreement is entered into by the undersigned individuals or entities (“Members”) for the joint acquisition, ownership, and management of one **Unity Node** (the “Node”) as offered by [UnityNodes.io](https://unitynodes.io).

### **2\. Purpose**

The Members agree to collectively invest in and communitise the Unity Node, blending real-world telecom verification infrastructure with crypto edge infrastructure, with the goals of:

* Gaining exposure to next-generation telecom \+ crypto systems.  
* Sharing both potential rewards and risks.  
* Learning and experimenting with Unity Node operations.

### **3\. Investment & Ownership**

* **Total Cost:** USD 5,000  
  * Includes 200 Unity Licenses \+ USD 3,750 of on-market tokens (50% MNTx, 50% WMTx, locked 24 months).

* **Member Contributions:**  
  * Minimum: USD 250  
  * Maximum: USD 1,500

* **Ownership Shares:**  
  * Each Member will receive **SDNIIUN01 tokens** (100000 total) on Cardano equal to their USD contribution (**1**USD \= **20**SDNIIUN01).  
  * Example: A USD 500 contribution \= 10000 SDNIIUN01 tokens.

* **Tradability:**  
  * SDNIIUN01 tokens will be issued on the Cardano Network with its own policy.  
  * SDNIIUN01 tokens may be transferred, sold, or traded freely, representing ownership rights in this communitised infrastructure.

### **4\. Roles & Responsibilities**

* **Operations:** Members may volunteer or be delegated to run Unity Licenses (via phones), monitor rewards, or lease out licenses.

* **Decision-Making:**  
  * Major decisions (e.g., resale of Node NFT, reinvestment, liquidation at 24 months) require **majority approval** (\>50% of token holders by share).

* **Transparency:**  
  * Rewards and updates will be shared regularly with Members via a chosen platform (e.g., group chat, dashboard).

### **5\. Rewards & Returns**

* Rewards generated by Unity Licenses (carrier fees, leasing income, etc.) will be pooled and distributed **pro rata** based on each Member’s token holdings.

* Token appreciation (MNTx/WMTx) is speculative; proceeds from any eventual sale will also be distributed pro rata.

### **6\. Risks & Acknowledgements**

Members acknowledge:

* Tokens are locked for 24 months.  
* Crypto markets are volatile; values may rise or fall significantly.  
* Telecom adoption and Unity’s success are not guaranteed.  
* Regulatory risks may impact returns.  
* Rewards depend on active use and sufficient license operators.

### **7\. Exit Strategy**

* Before the 24-month lock expiry, Members may transfer their SDNIIUN01 tokens privately.

* After 24 months, Members may vote on whether to:  
  * Continue operations,  
  * Sell the Node NFT,  
  * Lease or resell licenses, or  
  * Liquidate holdings.

### **8\. Next Steps**

1. Confirm Member list (minimum 5, maximum 20).  
2. Finalize contributions and issue SDNIIUN01 tokens.  
3. Acquire Unity Node.  
4. **Assign roles.**  
5. Build the marketing plan.  
6. Start selling the 200 licences to run the app on iPhone/Android.  
7. Reassess after 12 months.
