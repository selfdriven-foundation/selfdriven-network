Just one bad DNS record can take down half the internet.  
That’s not a theory — it happens. The centralised structure of DNS (and the root authorities that govern it) has always been both the backbone and the bottleneck of the web.  

As artificial intelligence begins to automate more of how we find, trust, and connect information, it’s worth asking:  
**Do we still need URLs in a world run by AI?**  
And if not, what replaces them?

## Context: Why Now

The web was built for humans navigating pages — not for intelligent systems negotiating meaning.  

As AI systems begin to act on our behalf — managing identity, verifying credentials, and mediating value — the infrastructure that supports them needs to evolve.  
The URL, the certificate authority, and even the server are relics of a centralised era.  

We’re entering an age where *context*, *trust*, and *intent* matter more than *location*.  
That shift demands a new kind of addressing — one that’s **decentralised**, **verifiable**, and **semantic**.  

---

## From Locations to Intentions

The URL (`https://example.com/resource`) was designed for humans — a readable pointer to where something lives.  
But AI doesn’t need *where.* It needs **what** and **why.**

When an AI is asked to “fetch the verified constitution for selfdriven.foundation,” it doesn’t care which server hosts it.  
It cares whether the document is:
- Authentic  
- Current  
- Cryptographically verifiable  
- Connected to a trusted identity  

That’s a shift from **location-based addressing** to **meaning-based resolution** — or what you might call **intent-based networking**.

---

## The Architecture of Trust

To build an internet that can be reasoned about by AI — not just indexed — we need a new architecture of trust.

| Layer | Function | Example Technology |
|--------|-----------|--------------------|
| **Meaning** | AI / Intent Resolution | GPT, Agentic AI |
| **Trust** | DIDs / VCs / zkProofs | Identus, PRISM, SpruceID |
| **Naming** | Handshake / ENS / DID:WEB | `.selfdriven` |
| **Data** | IPFS / Arweave / Ceramic | Persistent content |
| **Execution** | Smart Contracts / Logic | Plutus, Midnight, Solidity |

Handshake sits in the **Naming layer** — the foundation that links human-readable meaning to verifiable cryptographic truth.

---

## Handshake: The Decentralised Root Zone

Handshake replaces the centralised DNS root (run by ICANN and a few large registries) with a **blockchain-based registry of top-level domains**.  
When you own a Handshake name like `.selfdriven`, you don’t lease it — you own it cryptographically.

That means:
- No registrar middlemen  
- No renewals  
- No single point of failure  

Your name becomes a **trust root**, one that AI agents can resolve without relying on corporate or government intermediaries.

---

## Handshake + DIDs = The New Trust Fabric

In the AI-first internet, we’ll likely see a stack like this:

| Layer | Role | Example |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Intent Layer** | What you want | “Fetch verified governance charter” |
| **Identity Layer** | Who’s involved | `did:selfdriven:foundation` |
| **Naming Layer** | Where it’s anchored | `.selfdriven` (Handshake TLD) |
| **Data Layer** | How it’s stored | IPFS / Arweave / graph databases |

Handshake provides the **cryptographic namespace**,  
while **DIDs** provide verifiable identity,  
and **AI agents** resolve intent dynamically.

Instead of a fragile web of URLs, we get a self-verifying network of meaning — where names are permanent and trust is native.

---

## Interoperability and Resolver Bridges

Handshake doesn’t replace DNS overnight — it *bridges* it.  
Resolver gateways like [hns.to](https://hns.to) allow `.hns` domains to resolve from traditional browsers, while AI systems can query Handshake’s blockchain directly.  

That means systems can operate across both **Web2 and Web3 namespaces**, allowing gradual adoption:
- Legacy browsers can still resolve `.com` and `.org`
- AI and decentralised apps can resolve `.selfdriven` natively
- Both point to verifiable records and DIDs underneath

This bridge layer keeps the web accessible while laying the foundation for a trust-native internet.

---

## AI Context Resolution in Action

Let’s imagine the next generation of the selfdriven.network AI assistant:

1. You ask: “Show me the official constitution for the selfdriven.foundation.”  
2. The AI looks up `.selfdriven` on the Handshake blockchain.  
3. That record points to a DID or IPFS hash.  
4. The DID document provides public keys and proof chains.  
5. The AI verifies the credential and delivers the document — no URL, no middleman, just provenance.

That’s **AI-native resource resolution** — grounded in decentralised naming and verifiable identity.

---

## What It Enables

A Handshake-based addressing system makes possible:
- **Trustless publication:** Governance documents, constitutions, or charters stored immutably and verifiably.  
- **Agentic access control:** AI agents referencing credentials directly from DID-linked namespaces.  
- **Decentralised governance:** Organisations publishing verifiable decisions without dependency on central web infrastructure.  
- **Human-readable sovereignty:** A `.selfdriven` namespace as both brand and blockchain identity — recognisable, but cryptographically secure.

---

## Why It Matters

The internet began as a network of **locations**,  
evolved into a network of **links**,  
and is now becoming a network of **intent**.  

Handshake keeps that evolution *anchored* — ensuring that as intelligence becomes the new interface, we still have a foundation of authenticity beneath it.

> Handshake is DNS for the self-aware web —  
> where names don’t just locate things, they mean things.

---

## Closing Reflection

The next web won’t be built from *pages* — it’ll be built from *proofs.*  
Handshake gives those proofs a name the world can trust.  

In a selfdriven world, intelligence isn’t centralised — it’s verified.  
And that’s the kind of infrastructure the AI era deserves.
