# The Human Interface

### Design Principles

- Keep data protected as close to the human as possible.
- Establish identity and trust using SSI.
- Share the minimum required to help with collective organisation. ie as required by a community.

### Hosted Interfaces

The interfaces serve different functions specific to an individual’s or community’s needs, all based on the same Core interface–managed data.

### Generate Your Own Interfaces

All interface code and data model schemas are open source, so you can also build and host your own human/community interfaces.
